Welcome to my programming portfolio!

This repository is where I showcase the projects, code samples, and experiments I've worked on while studying Computer Science and learning different programming languages and tools.

### ðŸ“š What's Inside

- **Java/** â€“ Projects and exercises written in Java.
- **Python/** â€“ Scripts and experiments with Python.
- **PHP/** â€“ Web-related code and server-side logic using PHP.
- *(More folders will be added as I grow this portfolio.)*

### ðŸ§  Purpose

This portfolio reflects my journey as a learner and aspiring developer. It includes class projects, independent practice, and experiments across different areas like back-end development, mobile apps, and software testing.

### ðŸš€ Stay tuned!

I regularly update this repository as I learn more and build new things. Feel free to explore and see how my skills evolve over time.
