Completed in 1894, the bridge is renowned for its two Gothic-style towers and its central section that lifts to allow ships to pass. Tower Bridge was designed to ease road traffic while maintaining river access to the busy Pool of London docks. Today, it remains one of the cityâ€™s most iconic landmarks, attracting tourists with its panoramic walkways and Victorian engineering exhibitions.");
