FareTix.com – a platform I’m developing to enhance my software skills. 
This site connects to the NRE API to display real-time train schedules and updates.
It’s a continuous learning project where I add new features and improvements over time.
Through FareTix, I’m growing in backend integration, API development, front-end design, and secure data handling. 
Follow along as I refine this platform and share my journey as a software engineer.
