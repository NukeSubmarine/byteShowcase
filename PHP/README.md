# 🐘 PHP Projects & Experiments

Welcome to the **PHP** section of my programming portfolio!  
Here, you'll find web development code, backend logic, and experiments using PHP — one of the most widely used server-side scripting languages.

## 📂 What's Inside

This folder includes:

- Backend exercises from my studies
- Small web applications and logic demos
- Hands-on practice with form handling, sessions, and database interactions

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This space reflects my growing knowledge of server-side programming and how web technologies interact behind the scenes.  
These projects help reinforce:

- Core PHP syntax and logic
- Dynamic content generation
- Data handling and form validation
- Preparing for full-stack development

## 🚧 Still Growing!

I’ll be expanding this section with more structured projects as I continue learning frameworks like **Laravel** and improve my back-end development skills.

Stay tuned for updates!
