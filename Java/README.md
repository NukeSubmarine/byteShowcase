# Java Projects

This folder contains all my Java programming work as part of my learning journey in Computer Science.

## 📌 About

Here you'll find mini-projects, exercises, and experiments I've created while studying Java. These cover a range of topics including:

- Core Java syntax and logic
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Gradle-based project structure
- Console applications and simulations
- Practice with classes, interfaces, and exception handling

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each subfolder represents a self-contained Java project. For example:

- `SimpleBankAccount/` – A basic console application simulating simple bank account operations.

More projects will be added as I continue to learn and build in Java.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this section is to track and showcase my progress in Java. All code is written and maintained by me, and reflects what I’ve been learning and practicing.
